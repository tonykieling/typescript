# npm i -g typescript
# tsc --watch a_paticular_file.ts
  instead, it is okay to have in packge.json "build": "tsc --watch" - when rootDir is set on tscconfig.json
# tsc --init --> creates tscconfig.json
  some of the possible configs:
   outDir and rootDir 

*** it is possible to work with TS without the tscconfig.json file.
in this case, it will follow the default settings from tsc and needs to use watch or compile every time

*** the tesc is used to compile/convert from TS to JS, which is the language the browser understand
